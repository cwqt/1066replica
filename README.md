1026, again again.

Inspired by [1066](https://armorgames.com/play/4594/1066).

## Key goals

* **Logic separated from UI**
* **No UI developed before logic & networking sorted**
* Multi-player
* Higher entity count (~100 units)
* More eras (e.g. Roman, WW1)
* Larger maps (up to 50x150)
* Smarter skirmish AI
* More entity actions
* Map builder
* User-defined paths (not limited to two directions in one movement)
